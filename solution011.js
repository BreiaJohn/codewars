// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
    // your code here
  return Math.max(wait + on -cap, 0)
  
  }
