// Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

// Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

function past(h, m, s){
    //#Happy Coding! ^_^
  const convertHours = h * 60 * 60 * 1000;
  const convertMinutes = m * 60 * 1000;
    const convertSeconds = s * 1000;
  return convertHours + convertMinutes + convertSeconds;
  }
